A repositry for all my mad inventions - because I'm CRAZY!

Okay so a read-me (I'll probably continue to update this if I expand my list of crazy inventions)

1. cars.py - this project asks the question is it cheaper to either continue running an old car or to buy a new one.
  At the moment it is a series of questions with an answer at the end;
  however I'd like it to become a table and form query later on down the road.. I'm not sure.
